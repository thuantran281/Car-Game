# 2D Car Game
A simple 2D car game built with HTML5Canvas, CSS, and JavaScript. The game requires the player to control the car using arrow keys to avoid the obstacles popping up, including barriers and cars going on the opposite way.

# Further improvement
The game is still missing some of the critical parts, such as scores, levels, speed. The project will be enhanced with score HUD, level, and speed corresponding as the higher the level is, the faster the car and obstacles are, and the more difficult the game 
is. Finally, responsive will be implemented later on.
